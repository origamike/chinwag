We've got a new way to talk (talk, talk).
---------
Inspired by [@omgstephlol](https://twitter.com/omgstephlol/status/417507603695276032) and my desire to learn more about making web pages.

### What is it?
It's 10 lines of CSS that tilt text left or right depending on which class you apply to your HTML elements.
### WHAT?
It makes conversations [look like this](http://jsfiddle.net/wCDar/2/).
###Oh. How do I use it?
I'm working on that.

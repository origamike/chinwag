chinwag
=========
We've got a new way to talk (talk, talk).
---------
Inspired by [@omgstephlol](https://twitter.com/omgstephlol/status/417507603695276032) and my desire to learn more about making web pages.

### What is it?
It's [about 10 lines of CSS](http://origamike.github.io/stylesheets/chinwag.css) that tilt text left or right depending on which class you apply to your HTML elements.
### WHAT?
It makes conversations [look like this](http://jsfiddle.net/wCDar/2/embedded/result/).
### Oh. How do I use it?
I'm working on [that](http://origamike.github.io/chinwag).
### OK, but you missed something obvious.
Thanks! [Email](mailto:mike@tesserapps.com?subject=chinwag) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@origamike%20re:%20chinwag,%20) it at me, and I'll fix it.
